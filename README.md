# Orthodontic Diagnosis AI Prototype - thesis-porto

## About
This repository contains the prototype for my undergraduate thesis at the Faculty of Computer Science, University of Indonesia. The project focuses on the "Development of Object Detection and Classification Models for Early Diagnosis in Orthodontics" and was completed in December 2023.

## Overview
This prototype utilizes Object Detection and Classification models for early diagnosis in orthodontics. By uploading your photo to the program, you can receive an instant orthodontic diagnosis, including assessments such as Face Symmetry (Horizontally and Vertically), Face Types, Smile Lines, and many more.
